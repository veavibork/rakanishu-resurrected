"Hello, thank you for that comment about Rakanishu!

Yes I dropped it, the game mechanics became much more complex than I expected it to be which means that every small change took me a lot of time to not break game balance. Also I wasn't very happy about the next upgrade I was working on so I figured it was not worth the time.

I'm glad you enjoyed it though !"

The game has only been available to play on archive.org: https://web.archive.org/web/20230607032938/https://rakanishu.netlify.app/

While the game itself works, it's missing critical functionality (save/load in browser memory) as well as less critical (most of the icons). My only contribution so far is to get it up and running again, and to replace the missing icons to the best of my ability.
