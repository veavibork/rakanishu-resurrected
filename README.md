Current state: all links and game functions are expected to work as much as they did before. All graphics (that I know of) have been restored or replaced using game-icons.net. Some typos have been cleaned up.

The game ends with act 3, so if you beat Mephisto, you beat the game. Start speedrunning!

Rakanishu was created by Quetzalcoatl in 2022. As of 2023:

"Hello, thank you for that comment about Rakanishu!

Yes I dropped it, the game mechanics became much more complex than I expected it to be which means that every small change took me a lot of time to not break game balance. Also I wasn't very happy about the next upgrade I was working on so I figured it was not worth the time.

I'm glad you enjoyed it though !"

The game has only been available to play on archive.org: https://web.archive.org/web/20230607032938/https://rakanishu.netlify.app/

While the game itself works, it's missing critical functionality (save/load in browser memory) as well as less critical (most of the icons). My only contribution so far is to get it up and running again, and to replace the missing icons to the best of my ability.

I genuinely think the dude just wants to be left alone, but https://buymeacoffee.com/rakanishu is still up. I have to believe he still likes coffee. Just don't bug him for support or feature requests. For that matter, don't bug me; I'm doing my best to understand obfuscated compiled javascript and I don't know what I'm doing. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
